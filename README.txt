README
======

This project includes a dependency injection library I wrote for my
Zend Framework based sites. The project contains the source (CBCommon_DI)
for use in your own projects and an example of its usage.

The project may contain bugs and may not be production ready. Use at own risk.
Software from ClickMagnate.com. See LICENSE.txt for license and use terms.
Zend library needs to be on the include path.
